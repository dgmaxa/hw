<h1>Welcome to Doug Maxa's Homepage</h1>

<h2>About me:</h2>
<p> am a dedicated second year MBA candidate at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, where I am
    honing my strategic and analytical acumen in the heart of 
   Washington, D.C. My journey before Georgetown was 
   deeply entrepreneurial, marked by the successful launch and 
   growth of Helios English Academy in Hanoi, Vietnam. This 
   venture from inception to scale has endowed me with a 
   robust set of management skills and a rich understanding of
    business dynamics in a cross-cultural setting.
   Now, as I transition back to the corporate landscape in the USA, 
   I am eager to bring my diverse experiences to bear, leveraging
    my business insight and innovative mindset to drive sustainable 
   growth and excellence in a dynamic corporate environment.
